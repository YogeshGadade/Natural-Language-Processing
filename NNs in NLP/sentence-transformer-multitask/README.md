# Sentence Transformer and Multi-Task Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **Sentence Transformer** and its extension into a **Multi-Task Learning Model**. The tasks include:

- **Task A**: Sentence classification.
- **Task B**: An additional NLP task (e.g., Named Entity Recognition or Sentiment Analysis).

The code is written in Python using the Hugging Face `transformers` library and executed in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Contents

- **Sentence_Transformer_MultiTask.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and discussion responses.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the notebook.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentence-transformer-multitask.git
